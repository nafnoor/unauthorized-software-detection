Author - NAFISA NOOR

## 1. Project Overview
The project was about detecting unauthorized software in labs. Built a Python-based system that fetches all installed software from a PC, compares it with an authorized list in Google Sheets, and flags any unauthorized ones. The results are sent via email to the administrator and also shown in a Tkinter-based GUI. This project was impactful because it addresses a real-world cybersecurity challenge while being cost-efficient and user-friendly.
